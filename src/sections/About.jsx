          I'm Aryan, an AI-driven Frontend Developer passionate about building modern, responsive, and intelligent user interfaces. I specialize in combining traditional frontend technologies like React, Tailwind, and modern JavaScript with the power of AI-assisted development tools to deliver faster, cleaner, and more innovative solutions.

With a strong focus on UI/UX design, automation, and productivity, I leverage AI to speed up coding, enhance design consistency, and create interfaces that feel intuitive and future-ready. My goal is to craft seamless digital experiences that not only look great but also integrate AI-powered efficiency for startups and businesses.
